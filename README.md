## Welcome to my GitHub page!

Check out the pinned repositories for a Python-interface multi-scale parallelised coupled modelling system for Wave-Current Interactions (WCI) in regional scales. The system is comprised of the spectral wave model SWAN (Simulating Waves Nearshore) and the 2-D shallow-water equation model Thetis. The coupling is facilitated through the lightweight generic interface BMI (Basic Model Interface). <br /> 

This project is the result of my PhD research, with the thesis available here: <br />
https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/41614. <br />
Keep an eye out for upcoming demos, examples, and practical applications!
